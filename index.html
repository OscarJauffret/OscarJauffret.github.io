    <div class="project">
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/OscarJauffret/Flowshop-challenge" target="_blank">Operational Research Challenge</a>
            <span class="project-type-academic">Academic</span>
            <span class="project-lang">Python</span>
        </h3>
        <p>A challenge set by the professor to be completed within an evening.
            The task involved solving a flow-shop scheduling problem aimed at minimizing both the total makespan and
            global waiting time. The goal was to develop multiple solutions that would create a Pareto optimal frontier.
            I successfully won this challenge, which resulted in earning additional points for the course.</p>
